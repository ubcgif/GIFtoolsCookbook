Object Functionality
====================

All of the these functions can be accessed through the menus at the top after selecting the object in the GIFtools tree. The main categories presented here are:


In GIFtools, data, meshes, models and other things are defined as 'objects'. By doing this, GIFtools ensures that the user may only

Here, we describe the specific set of actions (or methods) which can be applied to each type of object.
