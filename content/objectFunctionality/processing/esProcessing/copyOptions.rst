Copy an equivalent-source item
==============================

Once the equivalent-source program has run and the results loaded, GIFtools does not allow the straight copying of the equivalent-source processing item (it has been "archived"). It does, however, allow you to copy the options that were chosen for the equivalent source to a new one. Click on the equivalent source item, select the menu showing its class (e.g., ``MAGEquivalentSource`` or ``GRAVEquivalentSource``):

**[Equivalent source class]** |rarr| **Copy options**
