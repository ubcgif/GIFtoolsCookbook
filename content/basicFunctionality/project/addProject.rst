Add another project
===================

GIFtools gives the user the ability to combine other projects that have been saved. To add an existing project to the current project, use the structure found below. The added project will become its own folder in the tree. 

**Project** |rarr| **Add existing project**

.. figure:: ../../../images/projectMenu.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400

**NOTE:** The shortcut for the functionality is ``control + shirt + L`` (lower case).
