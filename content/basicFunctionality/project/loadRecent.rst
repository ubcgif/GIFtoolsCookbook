Load a recently-saved project
=============================

GIFtools will save the last six projects that have been saved. To load a recently-saved project, use the menu structure below. You will be asked to if you want to discard your changes (even if you have just saved). Select **Yes** and the project will load and update, if neccessary.

**Project** |rarr| **Load recent project** |rarr| **[project name]**
