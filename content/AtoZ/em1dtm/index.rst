A to Z Examples for EM1DTM
==========================

Here, we demonstrate the interpretation of TEM data through both independent
Laterally constrained pseudo-3D inversion approach. We will make use of the
latest inversion routines developed by the open-source community: `SimPEG
<https://github.com/simpeg/simpegEM1D>`_ + `empymod <https://empymod.github.io/>`_ . The tutorial for the EM1DTM inversion code is
split into two parts:


    .. toctree::
       :maxdepth: 1

       Importing raw time-domain data <assignUncertainties>
       Laterally Constrained 1D Inversion <lateralInversion>
       Mesh validation for TDoctree inversion <meshValidation3D>
