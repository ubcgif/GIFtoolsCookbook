Mesh Validation for TDoctree v2
===============================


Here, the model obtained in the previous exercise
:ref:`AtoZ Time-Domain 1D<AtoZem1dtm_lateral>` is used to assess the validity of an octree mesh
used by the `TDoctree v2 <https://tdoctree.readthedocs.io/en/tdoctree_v2/>`_ inversion code.

.. As part of this exercise, the user will:

..     - :ref:`Set<AtoZem1dtm_lateral_setup>` create an octree mesh
..     - :ref:`Invert<AtoZem1dtm_lateral_inversion>`
..     - :ref:`Interpret<AtoZem1dtm_lateral_discussion>` the inversion results generated by the algorithm
