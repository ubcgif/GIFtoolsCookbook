Here, we demonstrate the interpretation of FEM data through both independent
1D inversions and with a laterally constrained pseudo-3D inversion approach.
Although full 3D FEM inversion algorithms have been developed, computing
resources and processing time are often limiting factors. Meanwhile 1D and
laterally constrained pseudo-3D inversion approaches are computationally fast
algorithms and capable of recovering bulk information about 3D conductivity
and susceptibility structures. The tutorial for the EM1DFM inversion code is
split into three parts:
