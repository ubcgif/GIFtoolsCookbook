Comprehensive Workflows
=======================

This section of the GIFtools cookbook is meant to provide practical tutorials for inverting field-collected data. Generally, the user will start with topography and geophysical data in a standard format. The ultimate goal is to invert the field collected data and recover a model that can be used for interpretation. Successful inversion of geophysical data using the UBC-GIF framework requires:

  - Understanding geophysical anomalies produced by basic structures
  - Importing geophysical data and topography into GIFtools
  - Transforming data from other conventions to the UBC-GIF convention
  - Basic interpretation of the data
  - Assigning appropriate uncertainties
  - Designing an appropriate mesh
  - Inverting the data with reasonable parameters
  - Assessment and interpretation of inversion results
