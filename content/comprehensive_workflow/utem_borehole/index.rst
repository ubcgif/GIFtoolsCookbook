Comprehensive Workflows: Borehole UTEM
======================================


Here, we present a general workflow for loading, interpreting and inverting borehole "University of Toronto ElecroMagnetometer" (UTEM) data. We begin with UTEM data in AMIRA TEM files. Our goal is to invert the data to recover a 3D conductivity model. You may work with the tutorial dataset provided or your own data:

.. The data used for this tutorial were collected at Dufferin Lake as part of a uranium exploration project. The data are public domain. They were downloaded from the `Saskatchewan Mineral Assessment Database <https://www.saskatchewan.ca/business/agriculture-natural-resources-and-industry/mineral-exploration-and-mining/saskatchewan-geological-survey/saskatchewan-mineral-assessment-database-smad>`__ . The original data have been down-sampled to make the size of data files more manageable.
